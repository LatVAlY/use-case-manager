Workshop Transcript — Q4 Digital Strategy Session

Moderator: Let's start with your biggest operational pain points.

Thomas (Head of Sales): We keep losing leads because our sales team has zero
real-time visibility into which customers are about to churn. We need an early
warning system — something that flags accounts before they leave.

Sandra (CTO): We already collect clickstream data. We could build a predictive
churn model on top of it. Doesn't need to be perfect, just directional.

Maria (Operations Manager): From my side, the biggest bottleneck is manual invoice
matching. We process around 500 invoices a month and the team spends three full
days on it every month. Even automating 70% would be huge.

Thomas: And if the invoice data were cleaner, our revenue reporting would actually
be accurate. Right now we're always two weeks behind on actuals.

Sandra: We also discussed customer onboarding last quarter. New clients wait 5 to 7
days for account setup because everything is manual in the back office.

Thomas: We lost two enterprise accounts because of that delay. It's a real problem.

Maria: One more thing — our supplier contracts are PDFs scattered across shared
drives. Nobody knows when they expire. Last month a contract auto-renewed and
cost us 40,000 euros because nobody caught it in time.

Sandra: A contract intelligence tool would solve that — something that parses PDFs
and surfaces expiry dates and key clauses automatically.

Thomas: Can we also look at the weekly sales report? I spend four hours every
Friday pulling numbers from five different systems by hand.
